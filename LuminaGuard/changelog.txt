Below is the improved codebase for "LuminaGuard" encapsulated as a single `.txt` content. It includes suggestions from the review, best practices, and additional customization features to create a more maintainable, robust, and future-proof solution. This code is arranged similarly to the previously provided code so that `decompile_code.py` can be used to restore the individual files. The improvements address initialization order, error handling, minimal MVVM structures, conditional onboarding, versioned config, updated System.Text.Json, better null checks, more user-friendly messages, and placeholders for future enhancements like dependency injection and plugin-based architectures.

The code is intended as a template or starting point. Some suggestions (e.g., full MVVM) are only partially integrated due to complexity. Further refactoring is encouraged.

Please note:
- We’ve introduced a `FirstRunCompleted` flag in `UserConfig` and conditionally launch OnboardingWizard or MainWindow.
- We’ve moved UI-dependent logic in MainWindow to Loaded event handlers.
- Added null checks and improved exception logging.
- Added placeholders for versioned config handling.
- Updated System.Text.Json to a hypothetical newer version (replace the version number as needed).
- Improved user messaging and introduced a setting to skip Night Light/f.lux warnings after first run.
- Introduced minimal separation for future MVVM: A `MainViewModel` class is included to show how properties could be data-bound. Actual data binding in XAML would need to be implemented for a full MVVM conversion.
- Added concurrency-safe logging with a lock.
- Profiles and config files now have a version field for potential migrations.

Once saved as `LuminaGuard_Code_Compilation.txt`, running `decompile_code.py` should reconstruct the files in a `LuminaGuard` directory.
